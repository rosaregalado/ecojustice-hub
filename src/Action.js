        <p>Environmental justice issues have far-reaching and devastating impacts on marginalized communities 
          around the world, and it is imperative that we take action to address them. According to the World Health Organization, 
          around 12.6 million deaths per year are attributed to environmental risks such as air pollution, chemical exposure, and water contamination. 
          Additionally, studies have shown that communities of color and low-income communities are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards and have higher rates of environmental health problems. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Taking action against environmental injustice is not only a matter of social and environmental justice, but it also has significant implications for public health and the well-being of our planet.</p>
